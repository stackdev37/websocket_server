v0.2.0 - Nov 25th 2011
======================

  * Major rework to make sure all the Autobahn test cases pass. Also updated the internal tests to cover more corner cases.

v0.1.2 - Nov 14th 2011
======================

  * Back and forth, back and forth: now settled on keeping the api (event names, methods) closer to the websocket browser api. This will stick now.
  * Started keeping this history record. Better late than never, right?
